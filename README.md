# d3-project
project d3 for udacity

Goal: Create scatterplot graph showing whether weight impacts number of home runs hit.  Also the players are color coded based on their hitting handedness (left handed, right handed, switch hitter).  I am trying to assign the players to buttons that such that their data is only shown when the button is pressed.  

I am trying to get the buttons to work using the geo world cup update examples from the lessons but I seem to be missing something.
